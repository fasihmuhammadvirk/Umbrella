# Website

Our project's major objective was to design a website using the skills we learned about web development in the ICT course and online that would allow users to access websites of various genres in one location.

## Description
In this project, we showed off our front-end development abilities. We were only at the beginning stages of web development, therefore the website wasn't responsive. The website had sufficient functionality to allow backward and forward navigation. The website has a homepage and several pages that were linked from it. The web pages were made up of a header that directed readers to different parts of the page and a footer that had buttons to navigate to the top of the page and functional social networking handles. An "about" part, a "team" section, and a mock responsive section made up the homepage. By selecting the button in the area below the header on the main page, you can access the other pages. Information regarding websites of that particular genre could be found on the other web pages. By clicking the names or photos of the mentioned websites, one can quickly visit them.

## Essentials to run the code
- Visual Studios Code
